<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Dmitrii 👋</h1>

Aspiring **Software Engineer** with a solid foundation in DevOps, backend development, and system-level programming.  
I’m passionate about building reliable and scalable infrastructure, exploring modern software technologies, and turning ideas into practical solutions.

Currently studying at **Ecole 42**, where I work on hands-on projects that cover C/C++, low-level memory management, multithreading, network programming, containerization, and system design.  
Alongside, I actively develop skills in cloud platforms, CI/CD, and automation — as well as explore areas like **web technologies**, **DevOps**, and **interactive applications** such as games or mobile tools.
