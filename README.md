### I'm Dima, a 21School or 42Ecole Student 👋

I like to automate, optimize various processes, create something new and share the knowledge gained. 
The ability to interact and communicate with people is a real pleasure. 
It was always interesting for me to solve various logical and mathematical problems. 
I created this repository to share my knowledge in this area and to make it easier for you in this direction. 

If you need anything like a bit of help for a project 🗣️,  explanations of my codes 💬 , or want to have a beer 🍻, 
you can find me on: 
Slack (buthor);
Telegram https://t.me/dvsavchenko (@dvsavchenko);
email : dvs.rocker@gmail.com.

It's time to learn something new! It's time to CODE!
Welcome to this exciting journey!
