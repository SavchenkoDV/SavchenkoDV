### <h1 align="center">I'm Dima, a 21School or 42Ecole Student 👋</h1>

<p align="left">I like to automate, optimize various processes, create something new and share the knowledge gained.<br> 
The ability to interact and communicate with people is a real pleasure.<br> 
It was always interesting for me to solve various logical and mathematical problems.<br> 
I created this repository to share my knowledge in this area and to make it easier for you in this direction.<br> 
<br>
If you need anything like a bit of help for a project 🗣️,  explanations of my codes 💬 , or want to have a beer 🍻,<br> 
you can find me on:<br>
Slack: buthor;<br>
Telegram: @dvsavchenko;<br>
email: dvs.rocker@gmail.com.<br>
<br>
It's time to learn something new! It's time to CODE!<br>
Welcome to this exciting journey!
